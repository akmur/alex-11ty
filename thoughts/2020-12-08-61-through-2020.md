We're 61% through 2020. Quite a year so far.

Today we learn about massive layoffs at Mozilla, involving MDN and Devtools team. It seems clear to me that if you lay off the devtools team, you don't want to keep playing the browser game.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So to summarize what we know so far, the following teams at Mozilla have been either eliminated or gutted to oblivion:<br><br>* Firefox devtools<br>* Firefox incident/threat management team (?!)<br>* Servo<br>* MDN<br>* WebXR/Firefox Reality<br>* DevRel/Community (???)<br><br>I guess they&#39;re giving up?</p>&mdash; Kat March√°n üçëüçëüçë (@zkat__) <a href="https://twitter.com/zkat__/status/1293585676336693253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One can't fail to see a pattern there, and wonder: will we soon get a Chromium based Firefox browser? I think it's likely.
What this will in case it happens, I'm not exactly sure.

**But** if that is indeed the case, we're going to need good devtools in Safari I think, so we can test our stuff out.

We'll see I guess.
