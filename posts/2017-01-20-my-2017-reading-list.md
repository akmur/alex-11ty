Here is my 2017 reading list. . Also, I've decided to start using [Goodreads][1] more consistently in my effort to read more!
Some of the books (the ones marked with \*) are taken from [Scott Adams' "Persuasion Reading List"][2]. The reason why I'm adding them is that I think it's good to be a little bit more aware of what happens around us.
Some others (the ones with two \*\*) were recommended by my good friend <a href="https://olegs.be" target="_blank">Oleg Belousov</a>.
