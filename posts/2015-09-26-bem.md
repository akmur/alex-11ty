excerpt: "I think there is often a little bit of misunderstanding when frontend developers and designers talk to each other about dimensions on the web. Designers generally design in pixels, obviously. Frontend developers then usually develop in _ems_ and rems. This post wants to bridge a knowledge gap that I feel might exist."

I like [BEM][1]. BEM stands for "Block, Element, Modifier" and it's a way to write your CSS class names in an organized way.

I've recently been at the [From the front 2015][2] conference in Bologna, where [Harry Roberts][3] (creator of Inuit) gave a [sweet talk][4] about structuring your CSS while keeping your sanity. Throughout the presentation he used the BEM naming convention, which I've also started using recently; it's easy to understand and really helped me make sense of large stylesheets.

So I'm going to sum up BEM in just a few rules, let's start!

### Rule number 1: Class all the things

Always use classes instead of tag names (this is important!). For example, you willÂ have:

```
.btn {}
.header {}
.main-nav {}
```

instead of

```
button {}
header {}
nav.main-nav {}
```

This is because tags have higher specificity than classes, which would often result in difficulties when needed to change those values down the road. Also, never use IDs.

### Rule number 2: Blocks and elements

Main layout elements are the **"Blocks"** part of the **BEM** metodology.
Elements within Blocks are to be marked like follows: _.blockname\_\_elementname_

Example:

```
.users-list {}
.users-list__item {}
.users-list__link {}
```

and the relative html would be:

### Rule number 3: Modifiers

You will obviously have variants of an item. These are the Modifiers (the M in BEM). For example, classes for a default, a small and a large avatar would be named like follows:

```
.avatar {}
.avatar--small {}
.avatar--large {}
```

### Bonus rule: Javascript

For elements that work with Javascript, just add a special "js" class which you'll only use for Javascript tricks, without attaching any style to it:

```
<div class="item -js-cool-trick">
</div>
```

That's it! It's really easy, just a few simple rules make your code more readable and maintainable. Check out <a title="undefined" href="https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/css-for-software-engineers-for-css-developers" target="">Harry Roberts presentation</a> for lots of additional info and tips.
