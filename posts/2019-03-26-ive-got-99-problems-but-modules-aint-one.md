Since ES6 came out, we've been able to use modules to neatly modularise our code. One thing that might be a little confusing is that there are different ways to import and export modules, so in this post I would like to list most of those.

I have put together a little Codesandbox which might be useful in order to see different ways in which we can import and export modules.
