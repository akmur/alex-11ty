A few days ago, I was browsing [meetup.com][1] looking for front-end web-development meetups in my area (Milan, Italy) and to my surprise, I found none. There were a few quite specialized ones like [M&M Mean Milan][2], [MeteorJS Milano][3] or [MongoDB Milan][4], but I couldn&#8217;t fine a more generic one where people could talk about front-end in general.

So I was like &#8220;What the hell, let&#8217;s do it!&#8221; and I opened a new meetup group, the [Milano Front-end Web-development Meetup][5]. Since creating the group, we&#8217;ve already got 40 subscribers, which I think is cool.
The goal of the group would be to talk about all things front-end, from CSS to SVG to JS to HTML. I&#8217;ve also created a [Twitter][6] account to go with it.

The first meeting will be on the 30th of October so if you live in the area, then by all means join us!
