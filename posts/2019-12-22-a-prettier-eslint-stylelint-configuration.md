[Prettier][1]Â is a tool that allows your code to be automatically formatted according to certain rules.

It is a great time saver, because you can paste your code in any way you like, and upon saving it will be prettified. This is especially valuable in a team environment. Prettier works with JavaScript files and Scss/CSS files, and it&#8217;s even possible to automatically sort properties in Sass, by using stylelint and stylelint-order.

This is the magic that happens when you save a file:

**Scss**

**JavaScript**

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1519" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dec-22-2019-01-32-32.gif" alt="" width="696" height="414" />

So I have created for my own reference a starter configuration that enables your projects to highlight errors and format code on save according to [Prettier][1] rules.

This is the content of the repository:

You will need the **Prettier**, **Eslint** and **stylelint** packages for VS Code.
