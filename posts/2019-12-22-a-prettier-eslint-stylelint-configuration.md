[Prettier][1]Â is a tool that allows your code to be automatically formatted according to certain rules.

It is a great time saver, because you can paste your code in any way you like, and upon saving it will be prettified. This is especially valuable in a team environment. Prettier works with JavaScript files and Scss/CSS files, and it's even possible to automatically sort properties in Sass, by using stylelint and stylelint-order.

So I have created for my own reference a starter configuration that enables your projects to highlight errors and format code on save according to [Prettier][1] rules.

You will need the **Prettier**, **Eslint** and **stylelint** packages for VS Code.
