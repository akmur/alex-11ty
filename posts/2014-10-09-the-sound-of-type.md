Over the last year I&#8217;ve grown increasingly tired of the previous &#8220;dark&#8221; theme of my site; not that it was THAT bad, it actually did the job, but I felt it didn&#8217;t convey enough of what makes myself&#8230; well, myself. Wishing for something more light-hearted but still **legible**, and convinced these qualities were to come from a **good choice of type**, I started a quest for the perfect font, well before starting to code my new site.

I read a number of online resources on the matter, and a number of  books as well, with <a title="The Anatomy of type" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Anatomy-Type-Graphic-Typefaces/dp/0062203126" target="_blank">The Anatomy of Type</a> being probably my favourite; I also subscribed to <a title="Typecast" href="http://typecast.com/" target="_blank">Typecast</a> (which comes with a subscription to <a title="Fonts.com" href="http://www.fonts.com/" target="_blank">Fonts.com</a>) so that I could use not only very high quality fonts, but also those iconic fonts that have made history, like Helvetica, Gill Sans, or Futura.

One thing I&#8217;m sure I learnt is that there is no easy way or shortcut to choose fonts for a web project, although there are a number of guidelines and ideas that could be taken into consideration that can help you during your exploration. Here are a few:

- Always take into account the &#8220;soul&#8221; of the owner of the website. The font has to **sing** with her voice.
- When you are pairing fonts, you can try putting **one over the other**, and observe the peculiarities of the two fonts. Pay attention to the x-height of the two fonts (with x-height being the height of a lowercase &#8216;a&#8217;, &#8216;o&#8217;, etc).
- Also when pairing fonts, you could &#8220;cheat&#8221; by choosing two typefaces either made by the same artist, or in the same period, perhaps in the same geographical region too.
- If in doubt, or in a hurry, or you&#8217;re not sure, use Helvetica in a couple of variants.
- Give your fonts space to breath, by choosing a generous line-height and good spacing between sections.

During my adventures with type, I have realized that creating a font must be very much like creating **music**, as both arts require manual skills, inspiration, and a good  inclination toward understanding those underlying &#8220;divine&#8221; mathematic rules (well, musicians might not think of it often, but they do lots of maths).

For this very site, I first chose the British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans" target="_blank">Gill Sans </a>as the main body font but after playing with it for a long while, I then settled for <a title="Camphor" href="http://nickjob.co.uk/camphor.htm" target="_blank">Camphor</a> by Nick Job (also British). Why? Camphor is **more readable**, no question about it, while still retaining a **playful** soul.
I then chose the classic <a title="DIN" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451" target="_blank">DIN</a> (a german industrial typeface) in its heavy variant, because I like powerful headlines (and DIN can deliver that a lot), plus it sits very well with Camphor.

And it was to accomodate such headlines and body fonts, that the (admittedly simple) design of this personal site started to **grow in an organic way**, out of the &#8220;seeds&#8221; planted with my typefaces. First it was the font, then the font size for a paragraph, then the font sizes for headers, followed by margins and paddings and line-heights for my typographic elements. It was then time to define spacings and sizes for block elements, but at that point, the design was kind of done!

**Fonts before design**, that&#8217;s another tip worth trying out. I&#8217;ll try to keep it in mind.
