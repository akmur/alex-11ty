I really like tools, extensions and productivity softwares; every now and I read articles about this topic, and I always enjoy them a lot. A couple of days ago, I read [this one by Daniel Wirtz][1], so I thought I should write one myself.

Most of the apps over here are for Mac because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m rolling with at the moment, although there are some exceptions.

I decided to leave out mainstream apps (like Slack, or Visual Studio Code) because everybody knows them. In a future post I might write something more technical about VS Code extensions and other coding tools.

So, here we go, 14 apps I use everyday, randomly ordered.

### Alfred

[Alfred][2] is an app that is hard to explain. It&#8217;s like Spotlight, because it helps you find stuff or do some basic maths, but it&#8217;s much more that. It lets you make recipes and use pre-made ones. For example, I use the lorem ipsum recipe to generate phrases or words or the Evernote one to search notes, or the Dash one to search for documentation.
Honestly, I use like 5% of what it&#8217;s capable of, but it&#8217;s really cool.
The thing I use the most is the multiple clipboard though. Many apps provide multiple clipboard, but Alfred&#8217;s one integrates perfectly in my flow and is super fast.<figure class="wp-block-image">

### Magnet

[Magnet][3] is a little utility I cannot live without. It allows you to easily snap windows to the right, left, centre or wherever you like, just by using a key combination.

</p>

### <figure class="wp-block-image"></figure>

### Sip

[Sip][4] is neat color picker. Yeah, nothing else, but perfect. Also, I love that it tells you cool color names. I especially love that.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1421" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image.png 596w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /> </figure>

### iStat

[iStat Menus][5] is a really nice application you can use to always know the status of your computer. How hot is it? How fast is it downloading? What&#8217;s the CPU load? Also, what&#8217;s the weather like tomorrow? Things like that.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1422" src="https://i2.wp.com/alexmuraro.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png?fit=640%2C719&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png 689w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-267x300.png 267w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-641x720.png 641w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /> </figure>

### Dozer

[Dozer][6] is a small free utility that lets you hide icons in your menu. Useful.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1424" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Nov-13-2019-23-58-28.gif" alt="" /> </figure>

### Bandwidth+

It can happen that I&#8217;m out with my computer and a tethered 4g connection. In that case, I want to know how much I have downloaded at any given time. [Bandwidth+][7] to the rescue. It will reset if you change network, and resume counting once you join it again. Simple and perfect.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1425" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png 448w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-300x101.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px" /> </figure>

### CleanMyMac

Yes, I know a Mac is not Windows, but still, [CleanMyMac][8] makes it so easy and satisfying to uninstall, cleanup, delete unwanted translation files, clean caches, detect big files you forgot in some obscure folder.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1427" src="https://i0.wp.com/alexmuraro.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png?fit=640%2C387&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 1157w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x181.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-768x464.png 768w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1024x619.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1157px) 100vw, 1157px" /> </figure>

### Boostnote

[Boostnote][9] is my main note taking app. It used to be Evernote, but now I mostly use this one, and Evernote only to save documents.
Boostnote is perfect for developers; it has markdown support, you can save code snippets with your chosen syntax, you can tag and categorise and search notes, it&#8217;s open source, it&#8217;s multi platform, a version for iOs and Android is coming, it can save notes on Dropbox or Google Drive&#8230; what else can one desire? I think it&#8217;s really good.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1428" src="https://i1.wp.com/alexmuraro.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5.png?fit=640%2C369&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5.png 1370w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-300x173.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-768x443.png 768w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1024x590.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" /> </figure>

### Giphy Capture

A picture is worth a thousand words, they say. Then what&#8217;s a GIF worth? A thousand pictures? That&#8217;s a million words. I really like this little tool, for the rare occasions I need to create a GIF. It&#8217;s not often, but when the need arises, Giphy Capture is there.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1429" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-6.png 554w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-6-300x233.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" /> </figure>

### Dash

This is an app that lets you download documentation for offline viewing: JavaScript, React, WordPress, Ruby, jQuery, Python&#8230; whatever you need, [Dash][10] probably has it, and if it doesn&#8217;t you can add custom Github repos. Plus, it lets you download an offline copy of Stack Overflow questions and answers related to whatever you&#8217;re interested in.
It also has some extra features like snippets, which I use a lot, especially to type things like this in a chat: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1430" src="https://i0.wp.com/alexmuraro.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-7.png?fit=640%2C470&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-7.png 1004w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-7-300x221.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-7-768x565.png 768w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-7-980x720.png 980w" sizes="(max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px" /> </figure>

### Better

[Better][11] is my adblocker on Safari. It works really well to the point that you forget its existence. I wish it existed for Chrome and Firefox too.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1431" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-8.png 380w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-8-263x300.png 263w" sizes="(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px" /> </figure>

### Karabiner-Elements

I have a Touch Bar MacBook Pro. It means I don&#8217;t have an ESC key, and no function keys either. I use [Karabiner-Elements][12] to remap the ESC key to Caps Lock, and F5 to the right Alt key (I use F5 to sort items when I code). Pretty useful.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1432" src="https://i0.wp.com/alexmuraro.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9.png?fit=640%2C371&ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9.png 1051w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9-300x174.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9-768x445.png 768w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-9-1024x593.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px" /> </figure>

### Monosnap

[Monosnap][13] lets you take screenshots, add comments and arrows to them, upload them and return a nice URL you can share. Probably not the only app to do that, but it&#8217;s functional. If you want it can upload to services like S3, FTP, Google Drive, but you need to be premium to do that.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img class="wp-image-1434" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-11.png" alt="" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-11.png 854w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-11-300x226.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-11-768x579.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /> </figure>

### RunJs

RunJS is a little software that just does what it says&#8230; it runs JavaScript.
Very useful to try out little algorithms, snippets, or npm packages.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1454" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-11.11.55.jpg" alt="" width="849" height="596" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-11.11.55.jpg 849w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-11.11.55-300x211.jpg 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-11-20-at-11.11.55-768x539.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px" />

UPDATE 06 December 2019

### SideNotes

I found out a couple of days ago about [SideNotes][14]. It&#8217;s really useful to have quick access to snippets or whatever notes you find yourself reaching for often. Also support basic code snippets and Markdown.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1509" src="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-12-06-at-12.47.55.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="717" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-12-06-at-12.47.55.jpg 404w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-2019-12-06-at-12.47.55-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" />
