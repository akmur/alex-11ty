As a Duckduckgo user, I sometimes (like, a couple of times a day) feel like I want to give Google a try to see if I get better/different results.

Since I got tired of copy/pasting my query, opening a new tab, go to google.com, and paste my query, I decided to create a little extension that does it for me. Just click on the blue button, and a new tab with your search within Google opens up.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1215" src="https://muraro.xyz/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dn4llky.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dn4llky.png 800w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dn4llky-300x168.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dn4llky-768x431.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][1]

It is called **&#8220;Search with Google instead&#8221;** and it can be downloaded from the Google extensions store.

[You can find it here][2]

PS: The extension also works with Bing.

PPS: I have been told Duckduckgo supports !bang queries. That is super, but still I think my extension solves a little problem for those quicker with their mouse than their keyboard.
