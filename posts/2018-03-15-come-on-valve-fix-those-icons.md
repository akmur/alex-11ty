_Update 24th October 2018: This is not the case anymore! Yay! The steam client has been updated, not sure when it happened, but it has happened! Hooray!_

Maybe it's my OCD, but you know what is the main reason i don't buy any game from Steam? No, it's not that I am on a Mac.

Also, it's not because Steam is a slow and bloated application, no.

The real reason are those icon in the top right corner, the ones used to close, minimize and maximize applications.

These ones:

You see, on current macOS those icons are nice and flat. Actually, they’ve been like that since 2014 when Yosemite was introduced.

Now, let me show you Steam for Mac.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1211" src="https://muraro.xyz/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ytu0e05.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="211" srcset="https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ytu0e05.png 800w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ytu0e05-300x211.png 300w, https://vccw.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ytu0e05-768x540.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />][2]

Yes, they are still the old pre-2014 icons.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1212" src="https://muraro.xyz/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/crtmgle.png" alt="" width="174" height="66" />][3]

Why. Why did Valve decide not to update the icons on their Steam client over these years?

Is it too hard? Should I really think that the people who created Portal are unable to replace three icons? Clearly not.

Do they have no employees or interns that can spend a few hours working on these icons? Also, clearly not the case, right? It’s freaking Valve we're talking about.

So the only option left is they don't care enough. And I hate giving my money to companies that do not care and cannot find one hour over the course of 4 years to improve their customer experience.

So I wonder, how many people are like me? This might be a very cost-effective UI improvement for Valve, especially because Mac people are fixated with UI consistency and stuff like this, it’s the main reason they get a Mac after all.

Actually, those icons are the reason i started using GOG in the first place. It surely helps that GOG is better than Steam in so many other ways, so I wouldn't go back now, but still&#8230; why, Valve?
