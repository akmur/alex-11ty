I have been working on a comprehensive and secure htaccess file to be used with a WordPress install. I have uploaded it on Github, <a title="Htaccess for WordPress" href="https://github.com/alemur/htaccess-for-wordpress" target="_blank">check it out</a> and contribute if you wish. (note: it forces https access, be sure to disable that part if you don't need it).
