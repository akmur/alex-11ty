    <p>Over the last year I've grown increasingly tired of the previous &quot;dark&quot; theme of my site; not that it was THAT bad, it actually did the job, but I felt it didn't convey enough of what makes myself... well, myself. Wishing for something more light-hearted but still <strong>legible</strong>, and convinced these qualities were to come from a <strong>good choice of type</strong>, I started a quest for the perfect font, well before starting to code my new site.</p>
<p>I read a number of online resources on the matter, and a number of  books as well, with <a title="The Anatomy of type" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Anatomy-Type-Graphic-Typefaces/dp/0062203126" target="_blank">The Anatomy of Type</a> being probably my favourite; I also subscribed to <a title="Typecast" href="http://typecast.com/" target="_blank">Typecast</a> (which comes with a subscription to <a title="Fonts.com" href="http://www.fonts.com/" target="_blank">Fonts.com</a>) so that I could use not only very high quality fonts, but also those iconic fonts that have made history, like Helvetica, Gill Sans, or Futura.</p>
<p>One thing I'm sure I learnt is that there is no easy way or shortcut to choose fonts for a web project, although there are a number of guidelines and ideas that could be taken into consideration that can help you during your exploration. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always take into account the &quot;soul&quot; of the owner of the website. The font has to <strong>sing</strong> with her voice.</li>
<li>When you are pairing fonts, you can try putting <strong>one over the other</strong>, and observe the peculiarities of the two fonts. Pay attention to the x-height of the two fonts (with x-height being the height of a lowercase 'a', 'o', etc).</li>
<li>Also when pairing fonts, you could &quot;cheat&quot; by choosing two typefaces either made by the same artist, or in the same period, perhaps in the same geographical region too.</li>
<li>If in doubt, or in a hurry, or you're not sure, use Helvetica in a couple of variants.</li>
<li>Give your fonts space to breath, by choosing a generous line-height and good spacing between sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>During my adventures with type, I have realized that creating a font must be very much like creating <strong>music</strong>, as both arts require manual skills, inspiration, and a good  inclination toward understanding those underlying &quot;divine&quot; mathematic rules (well, musicians might not think of it often, but they do lots of maths).</p>
<p>[tweet]I realized that creating a font must be very much like creating music.[/tweet]</p>
<p>For this very site, I first chose the British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_Sans" target="_blank">Gill Sans </a>as the main body font but after playing with it for a long while, I then settled for <a title="Camphor" href="http://nickjob.co.uk/camphor.htm" target="_blank">Camphor</a> by Nick Job (also British). Why? Camphor is <strong>more readable</strong>, no question about it, while still retaining a <strong>playful</strong> soul.
I then chose the classic <a title="DIN" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451" target="_blank">DIN</a> (a german industrial typeface) in its heavy variant, because I like powerful headlines (and DIN can deliver that a lot), plus it sits very well with Camphor.</p>
<p>And it was to accomodate such headlines and body fonts, that the (admittedly simple) design of this personal site started to <strong>grow in an organic way</strong>, out of the &quot;seeds&quot; planted with my typefaces. First it was the font, then the font size for a paragraph, then the font sizes for headers, followed by margins and paddings and line-heights for my typographic elements. It was then time to define spacings and sizes for block elements, but at that point, the design was kind of done!</p>
<p><strong>Fonts before design</strong>, that's another tip worth trying out. I'll try to keep it in mind.</p>
