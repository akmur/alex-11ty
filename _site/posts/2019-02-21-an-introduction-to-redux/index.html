    <p>Redux is a small popular library used to keep track of the state of an interface without going crazy. It is mainly used together with React, a popular library used to create snappy user interfaces on the web.</p>
<p>Getting started with redux might take a while, because you need to get accustomed to the way it does things. In this post i want to cut straight to the meat of the issue, without unnecessary technical explanations. I will show you how to get started with Redux in a React project.</p>
<h3>Why? {#why}</h3>
<p>Why another tutorial about Redux? Because I finally grasped it after struggling with it for a while, and I have the feeling a new tutorial with new ways to explain the same concept might be helpful.</p>
<h3>Credits {#credits}</h3>
<p>This tutorial would have not been possible without this one: <a href="https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/">React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide</a> which I recommend as it's much more in depth than mine and very easy to follow.
Another great tutorial that helped me greatly is this one: <a href="https://medium.com/@ohansemmanuel/table-of-contents-for-understanding-redux-1-ea0667e1453d">Understanding Redux — 1. – Ohans Emmanuel</a>
Also, once you have some understanding of Redux, I recommend checking out <a href="https://read.reduxbook.com/">Human Redux</a>, it's really well written.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites {#prerequisites}</h3>
<ul>
<li>node installed on your machine</li>
<li>some basic react knowledge might help (so you don't feel completely lost)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloning the project {#cloningtheproject}</h2>
<p>Instead of copy-pasting stuff from a webpage, let's be modern and just clone or download this Git repository:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/akmur/redux-tutorial">GitHub – akmur/redux-tutorial: Redux Tutorial</a></p>
<p>where you will find a little project already setup.</p>
<p>Once downloaded or cloned, open your Terminal and go to the project's folder, then type:</p>
<pre><code>npm install
</code></pre>
<p>followed by:</p>
<pre><code>npm run start
</code></pre>
<p>Now the application should be available at <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>.</p>
<h2>About the file structure {#aboutthefilestructure}</h2>
<p>Inside the &quot;src&quot; folder, the main files you will find are the following React files:</p>
<pre><code>./src
----User.js
----News.js
----Status.js
----index.js
</code></pre>
<p>And the following Redux files:</p>
<pre><code>./src
----redux
--------actions
------------index.actions.js
--------middleware
------------index.middleware.js
--------reducers
------------user.reducers.js
------------news.reducers.js
------------index.reducers.js
------------status.reducers.js
--------store
------------index.js
</code></pre>
<h2>Redux 101 {#redux101}</h2>
<p>The main concept behind Redux is that you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stores</li>
<li>Actions</li>
<li>Reducers</li>
<li>Middlewares (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stores is where all the information about state is stored.
Actions is where we dictate what needs to happen in the form of a simple object.
Reducers are where the new state is updated with information coming from the actions.
Middlewares make it possible to intercept actions, and introduce secondary effects (like dispatching a new action or making an AJAX request).</p>
<h2>How does this work? {#howdoesthiswork}</h2>
<p>I suppose we need some explanation, so we will be going through:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#react-index">React index file</a></li>
<li><a href="#react-component">React user component</a></li>
<li><a href="#redux-action">Redux action file</a></li>
<li><a href="#redux-middleware">Redux middleware</a></li>
<li><a href="#redux-reducer">Redux user reducer</a></li>
<li><a href="#redux-store">Redux store</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will do my best to keep this short.</p>
<h4>React index file {#react-index}</h4>
<p>At the top of this files, you have all the imports needed to make it work. The last two imports are related to Redux.
We are importing the &quot;Provider&quot; component and the Redux store we already created.</p>
<p>The Provider will take our store as prop and wrap our application so that every component can easily be informed of the current status.</p>
<h4>React User Component {#react-component}</h4>
<p>Found in:
./src/User.js</p>
<p>At the top of the file, we have our standard imports needed to load React, load the &quot;connect&quot; feature from Redux, and load our Redux actions.</p>
<p>Inside the component, in the beginning of the component's lifecycle, inside the componentDidMount() function, we check if data is already loaded, and if not, we load it.</p>
<p>Inside the render() function we simply output the data.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the file, we have &quot;const = mapStateToProps&quot;. Here we are mapping the user state saved in Redux, with the component's properties (props) so that they are available in the render() function.</p>
<p>In the last few lines, we are doing the actual plumbing, connecting everything together and exporting the component.</p>
<h4>Redux Action {#redux-action}</h4>
<p>Found in:
./src/redux/actions/index.actions.js</p>
<p>Then we have two functions, loadUser() and loadNews(). What they do is to basically return a simple object describing the action we want to perform. This action will be &quot;intercepted&quot; by the middleware, which in turn will take care of the AJAX requests.</p>
<h4>Redux middleware {#redux-middleware}</h4>
<p>Before we start, please note that I added some artificial delay to these Ajax requests, so the state change can be seen more easily.</p>
<p>Found in:
./src/redux/middleware/index.middleware.js</p>
<p>What this bit does is to intercept all actions and if, as an example, one called &quot;LOAD USER&quot; is found, it will dispatch a new action, in this case &quot;USER_LOADED&quot;, togerther twith a payload, in this case the result of an AJAX call.</p>
<h4>Redux User Reducer {#redux-reducer}</h4>
<p>Found in:
./src/redux/reducers/user.reducers.js</p>
<p>This reducer, receives a state (the default if none other is available, is initialState) and an action.
If the reducer receives the action ‘USER_LOADED' it will change the state accordingly. You can see some further comments in the snippet above.</p>
<h4>Redux store {#redux-store}</h4>
<p>Found in:
./src/redux/stores/index.stores.js</p>
<p>Here we are putting together all the stuff that we created; you can read more detailed comments in the code above.</p>
<h3>The Redux flow</h3>
<p>To sum up, the steps you need to follow to work with redux are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a store, which is done generally only once</li>
<li>Then, whenever you need to send to your store (which acts as a global state) some data you need to:
<ul>
<li>Create an action
<ul>
<li>If some AJAX or other side effects are required, set up a middleware to take that action</li>
<li>The middleware performs the AJAX operation, or whatever is needed</li>
<li>And it dispatches a new action, which is picked up by a reducer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reducer picks up the action, and modifies the state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the component, the content is changed according to the data coming from Redux</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions {#conclusions}</h2>
<p>I know there are many moving parts involved, but Redux seems like a great solution and it's probably here to stay.
What I generally like to do is to avoid almost completely the usage of component-level state, except for small UI-related information (e.g. show/hide a menu), and use Redux for everything else, with the advantage that important global state is available from anywhere in the App, I just need to &quot;connect&quot; to the redux store.</p>
<p>There is surely much more to it than what is in this guide, and I am probably just scratching the surface here, but hopefully this will be enough to get you started.</p>

    After having learnt about Redux from Valentino Gagliardi, I thought it would have been a good idea to explain it again in my own words. The more explanations, the better, so here's my contribution to the understanding of Redux for newcomers.
