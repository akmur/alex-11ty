My name is Alessandro Muraro, a frontend developer from [Milano, Italy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Milan,+Metropolitan+City+of+Milan/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4786c1493f1275e7:0x3cffcd13c6740e8d?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwic552K04zrAhXvRxUIHfYiACkQ8gEwAHoECAsQAQ).

I have been hacking away at websites since 1999, but it was simply an hobby for many years. In 2011, I started my professional career in frontend development.
Over the last 15 (!) years or so, I have been living around Europe: ItalyðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, the NetherlandsðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, IrelandðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª, and GermanyðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

Since November 2020 I am working with [Cleafy](https://cleafy.com/) where I take care of UI development as a frontend engineer.

# What I do

I am currently working daily with React at [Cleafy](https://cleafy.com/) in Milan. I am experienced in dealing with complex and/or legacy codebases, which I enjoy refactoring and getting back into shape. I specialize in coding modular, component-based websites. I am passionate about clean, maintainable, readable code and I fight the good fight against software entropy.
